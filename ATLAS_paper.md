Abstract
The ATLAS system, evolving since the late 1990s, stands as a dynamic and comprehensive
knowledge management tool that intends to address the complexities of modern information
supply chains. The antecedent to ATLAS was the Atlas of Risk, an informal assemblage of
various risks associated with digital interactions. Here we provide an initial specification for
digital prototypes and paper-and-pencil implementations of a matured ATLAS architecture which
integrates pattern language approaches with question-oriented procedures to manage and
interpret meaning and context. The ATLAS system facilitates the management and
communication of nuanced data sets and knowledge bases with an eye towards interoperability
without the need for fully shared standards, and . The development of ATLAS, driven by the
need for enhanced data interoperability and shared understanding in an increasingly complex and
volatile digital landscape, reflects a profound, community response to the challenges of
information environments and the fragility of extreme specialization. ATLAS's ongoing
evolution showcases its adaptability and significance in the realms of data analysis, knowledge
management, and cognitive security, and this first release of a technical specification establishes
a foundation for a transition from prototype to scale-appropriate implementation.

Introduction
The modern information supply chain is struggling to keep pace with the explosions in volume
and technical complexity of available information caused by its own innovations and
advancement. From the time it was possible for a single human being to possess a large
percentage of the knowledge in their immediate cultural context, to present day, our
sociotechnical infrastructure for advancing and sharing knowledge has been in a positive
feedback loop, compensating for the increasing rate of information production and the
ever-widening gap between available information and the limits of individual situational
awareness, capability, and memory. This general sociotechnical infrastructure, or more generally,
synthetic intelligence, is primarily composed of individual and organizational specialization and
expertise augmented by (i) knowledge, data, and narrative information management technologies
(e.g., libraries, notetaking and archiving methodologies, standards, and databases) and (ii)
generative and evaluative information processes and tools (e.g., the scientific method,
mathematics). However, in any complex adaptive system, specialization comes at the cost of
plasticity, or the ability to adapt to new circumstances.
In biology, this concept of trade-offs related to specialization is sometimes referred to as the
“fragility of extreme specialization”, and in engineering as “efficiency is fragility”. In terms of
the information supply chain, the diminishing returns of specialization are found in the
proverbial mountains of redundant and obsolete work caused, in part, by the innumerable
information silos generated by both knowledge specialization and the limits of human situational
awareness [1]. Each year, millions of peer-reviewed papers, preprints, reports, and data sets are
published, with valuable insights left unread and siloed across myriad domains. Even
organizations composed of individuals at the highest levels of competence are inevitably left to
manage the trade-offs among (i) filtering out, purposefully or otherwise, large swathes of
potentially valuable information, (ii) adapting to a constant state of information overload and
including large swathes of low-quality information, and (iii) externalizing analysis to generative
and other statistical models, which carries a set of risks so diverse that it would exhaust the scope
of any summary.
Information management systems, already struggling with factors such as provenance,
addressability, privacy, standardization, quality, and explainability are now threatened by the
emergence of highly accessible generative tools, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large
Language Models (LLMs), which will further flood this already overly rich information space
with the potential to bury more insight than they reveal. While modern information supply chains
manage the logistics of data reliably and at scale, similar attention now needs to be applied to the
logistics of meaning. Mechanisms for generating and sharing coherent maps of specialized
information silos and their intersections are necessary to maintain navigability of the information
environment.

Atlas of Risk
While the laws of physics and computing that support purely technical interoperability and
communications are global (and indeed universal), the laws of people and social and cultural
norms are not. As the standardized Internet technologies interconnected across the globe, the
flows of data made possible by the technologies encountered barriers from non-technical
network variables. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions prohibited access to certain
types of content, and intellectual property rights (such as under copyright, patent, trademark and
trade secret laws) also constrained the free flow of data and interactions. Further, notions of
intrusions on personal privacy of individuals invited specific forms of protection and limitations
on free flows of data, as did proprietary interests of businesses and secrecy and security needs of
governments. Emerging organically in response to the need to render new and emerging risks in
information networks visible and measurable, was The Atlas of Risk.
The Atlas of Risk was originally compiled (in the late 1990s, by Scott David, a contributor to
this document) as an informal checklist of non-technical definitions of common business and
legal risks associated with online and digital interactions and commercial transactions that
proliferated along with the highly distributed information infrastructure of the early Internet,
helping communicate siloed knowledge [2]. Following growth of and feedback on this initial
checklist, it began to mirror prior work on “Pattern Languages”, helping to make “patterns” of
practices visible so that they could be considered as candidates for formalization and
measurement. Pattern Language approaches, originally popularized by Christopher Alexander,
are intended to enable deep compressions of subjective commonalities in terms of objects and
phenomena in a given environment. Where Alexander’s work on the topic helped identify and
communicate ontology, intentions, conditions, and approaches in the domain of architecture [3],
the Atlas of Risk focused on information architecture and engagement.
ATLAS Exploration in 2023
Growing from the original informal checklist, the core listing of risks for the Atlas was compiled
in 2014 into a simple digital document and later, in 2016, into a slide deck format [2]. When the
slide deck exceeded 1,700 slides, it was clear that a more scale-appropriate and accessible
interface was needed. Building upon the foundational Atlas of Risk, contributors to this
document recognized that the Atlas of Risk represented an emergent, next iteration of prior
written pattern languages. Instead of snapshot publications of patterns from specific domains,
representing patterns of interest as data structures within a dynamic living knowledge resource
would allow for continuous development by relevant communities and exchange among them.
Work on a first digital prototype of an ATLAS (stylized in all upper-case) applied to common
vulnerabilities and exploits (CVE) databasing related to Cognitive Security began in March
2023, resulting in an “alpha” version of the “COGSEC ATLAS” [4] built using the low-code data
and knowledge management platform Coda.io. This alpha version did not offer full community
interactive capacity, but it did inspire local contribution and extension of the resource, and the
2
ATLAS - 10.5281/zenodo.10362561
research and development led to valuable insights related to Cognitive Security itself - mainly
that numerous communities maintain pattern languages with limited interoperability,
underscoring the necessity for enhanced integration approaches. More importantly, it revealed
valuable insights about how to render pattern language components interoperable across
domains, and what is possible given an appropriate data structure:
1. Using modular requests for information about a given pattern, which would resolve to
some other object (e.g., what is the remedy to this pattern of risk?), (i) allows new
patterns and objects to be generated and networked as a function of resolving requests,
and (ii) makes community contribution simpler and more measurable, productive, and
efficient (see Figure 1).
2. Giving patterns a flexible data structure (i.e., no set schema of potential attributes),
allowed for a greater variety of patterns from a variety of domains to become
interoperable in relation to the attributes they do share - and where attribute values and
attributes themselves are shared, new patterns can be revealed. Further, whole new
derivative ATLAS structures become possible, for example, (i) patterns of influence
which came from the Narrative Campaign Field Guide [5], a snap-shot of patterns related
to narrative influence campaigns, were easily rendered into a separate derivative ATLAS
(see Figure 2), and (ii) examples of emergent patterns become immediately and easily
filtered into their own provisional collections (see Figure 3).
3. Using a Reference ID system, which can be shared to establish common reference to
objects even where data about those objects might not be agreed upon, allows for simple
merging and disambiguation in sharing information among communities with ontology
overlaps and conflicts.
By onboarding contributors from an adjacent working group researching the structure of and
information latent within questions and integrating past work on question oriented
documentation [6] the following was revealed:
1. Using a combination of flexible parent-child relationships among patterns (e.g., a pattern
may be an example or child of another pattern) and lists of questions we would expect to
ask of items which fit some pattern (”QKits”), a “dynamic type system” emerges,
wherein objects are assigned implied Patterns as a result of being involved in a particular
request for information either as the subject or the response (e.g., the question: “what is
the national flag of this country?” reveals that the subject is a country, and the response, a
flag).
2. By carefully structuring the requests for information, we can not only route information
to fill multiple attribute values, but enable a variety of complex operations, including new
question generation and continuous updating of visualizations (see Figure 3).
3
ATLAS - 10.5281/zenodo.10362561
As a result, the ATLAS effectively became a structured question and pattern generator, allowing
several dozen collections of patterns related to Cognitive Security and from other fields to be
integrated rapidly, resulting in a collection of over 1,000 individual, networked patterns (see
Figures 5 and 6). Its initial release and controlled distribution revealed additional insights related
to reliability of information provision and accessibility, leading to a recognized need for special
designations for ATLAS instances with operators capable of being responsible parties in a larger
information supply chain.
This phase marked a significant step forward in our research methodology by integrating both
established and emerging patterns, and led the contributors to create a fresh set of data structures
intended to leverage the insights and theoretical foundations discovered through the first phase of
development. In this document, we present the resulting first version of a specification for digital
and paper-and-pencil implementation of a networked ATLAS, with the intent to expand its
contents based on feedback and continued work in 2024.

System Overview
Purpose
ATLAS, as a Knowledge Management System, is intended to:
● enable the development and documentation of local and community information
standards,
● facilitate rapid expansion and networking of knowledge,
● provide a basis for sharing common reference to objects (data, artifacts, abstractions)
within, between, and among communities,
● reframe intercoder reliability issues as useful information, and
● restructure existing and developing knowledge bases to:
○ enable interoperability and exchange,
○ reveal knowledge gaps by default, and
○ support synthetic intelligence by providing a foundation for stable communication
among human and automated agents, (e.g., by providing structured, streaming
updates to artificial intelligence agents using retrieval augmented approaches).
Scope
This document addresses the core components of the “ATLAS” system, a question-oriented
approach for structuring, expanding, and establishing relationships within a knowledge base, and
for dynamic typing of objects using pattern language approaches. The components, properties,
and methods included would allow for functionality of the core mechanisms of the system both
in digital prototype and paper-and-pencil implementations, similar to Zettelkasten, slip-box, and
other similar knowledge management approaches [7, 8].
This version of the document only defines the necessary components, properties, and methods of
the system which enable such paper-and-pencil implementation and pseudo-code, prototype
implementations, it does not address:
● methods, schemas, or systems for digital Reference ID implementation,
● methods, properties, or implementation of interfaces and capabilities related to prompts
(Prompt Interfaces),
● choice of programming languages or database software,
● technical implementation or supporting software and technologies, or
● data security and privacy.

ATLAS - 10.5281/zenodo.10362561
Various features important for multi-user implementations of ATLAS system are not addressed
here, such as:
● version control,
● governance, or
● explicit procedures for sharing data among independent ATLAS implementations.
These and similar aspects are left to designers, developers, and operators (DDOs) of ATLAS
implementations.

Theoretical Foundations
ATLAS makes use of a Pattern Language approach, in which any identifiable object may be
labeled and assigned attributes in common with other like-objects (i.e. patterns), structuring
abstract, esoteric, and complicated information within niche contexts and allowing
communication to occur through common reference to patterns [3]. Where traditional Pattern
Language approaches are ad hoc or tailored to a particular domain (e.g., architecture [3],
software [9], user experience design [10]), the version of ATLAS presented in this document
facilitates a generalization and scaling of the Pattern Language approach by (i) treating all
entities of interest (e.g., patterns, objects) as potential patterns or instantiations of patterns, (ii)
providing a flexible container for attributes as opposed to a preset schema, (iii) treating attributes
themselves as entities of interest, and (iv) incorporating a Question Oriented Design that
exploits the following principles (summarized inFigure 7):
1. A Request for Information Contains Information. By virtue of being self-generated,
questions reveal information about an agent’s situational awareness and goals. The
content, format, scope and even order of queries can reveal an agent’s intents and
approach to exploring a cognitive space, and information about how the agent classifies
the objects it presents queries about. At its core, a query is a request for information, and
the specificity of the request communicates information regarding the answer before the
answer has arrived. ATLAS treats queries which are requests for information about an
object (i.e., the value of an attribute), as a router (a) between agents and some defined
attribute of that object, (b) generalizable to other objects which also have that attribute,
and (c) which may contain information regarding expectations of attributes of objects
which might be values that could be held as responses to the query. This is to say that the
query “What is the flag of this nation?” is a router (a) between a human and the attribute
of some defined object representing a nation state, (b) that is generalizable to any other
nation state object, and (c) that holds information regarding the answers to the query -
that the object provided as a response to this query is a flag, with its own set of expected
attributes. Thus, by establishing information quality standards (e.g., standard questions
associated with like-objects, or objects which fit a particular pattern) we can both
generate new requests for information and classify objects as a function of resolving
requests for information. These structured queries are referred to as an instance query or
iQuery in the ATLAS system.
2. Missing Information is Information. One of the challenges knowledge management
seeks to address is missing information, often referred to as a knowledge gap. Filling
knowledge gaps is an ongoing subject of knowledge management research. The ATLAS
system is built with the acknowledgement of the fact that, paradoxically, a lack of signal
can communicate information. The structured query system which ATLAS implements
treats missing information as a serviceable request, and cannot recognize a missing data
13
ATLAS - 10.5281/zenodo.10362561
value which does not contain some respective routing instructions (e.g., a human legible
prompt, or an API request) to serve the request to an appropriate agent. Where such a
request cannot be initially handled, it reveals the missing information as a knowledge gap
by default. In the case that the requests simply cannot be handled, it reveals information
about the object that is the subject of the request for information, about how the request
was served, or about the request for information itself. For example, it may be the case
that the object is exceptional in terms of its class or pattern membership (e.g., a country
which has no single national flag), or there may be an anomaly preventing resolution
(e.g., a missing data value from a data set expected to have a value).
3. Disagreement Over Information is Information. Conflicting information is an intrinsic
part of informational landscapes. Instead of resolving the issue and negating the “wrong”
answer, proposed here is an acknowledgement that discord is signal, and measurable.
Disagreement over attribute values may be due to error, differences in scope, or due to
variable interpretations of the same observations. As such, ATLAS is designed for local
“instancing” of and sharing among knowledge bases as opposed to development as a
single, universal knowledge base - with an intent to allow global consistency of common
reference without requiring global consistency in standards, schema, or data values. So
long as there are opportunities for common reference and documentation, knowledge
bases become comparable, and as such, disagreement over standards, schema, and data
values become measurable and resolvable without necessarily requiring disruptive
rip-and-replace conformance or adoption of new standards.
Figure 7. Three kinds of information contained in question systems. In a classroom setting,
students raise hands to ask a question. We posit that (a) a question contains information, (b) lack
of answers from the students contains information, (c) disagreement over answers among
students contains information.

System Definition
Figure 8. Representation of the full ATLAS system.
Here, each of the core components of the ATLAS system, and their respective essential
properties are defined and described. The ATLAS system is intended to allow for numerous
stand-alone “instances” (referred to as an ATLAS instance), containing only several vital objects.
Reference IDs (RIDs), as noted in the Section regarding Scope, are not addressed in the
definition, but are noted as an essential property of core ATLAS objects - because they represent
an anonymous structure, they are referenced as an object as opposed to a String. Also included in
the systems definition are designations for ATLAS instances capable of communicating.
15
ATLAS - 10.5281/zenodo.10362561
Entity
Figure 9. Entity component definition
Objects of the Entity class are used to represent and enable common reference to tangible or
abstract objects and patterns of objects in physical, digital, or conceptual space. The Pattern,
Attribute, and Prompt Interface classes are each subclasses which inherit from the Entity class.
This class contains the following properties and methods:
Properties
RefID
○ A pointer to a RID, used for managing merge, import, and export operations with
other ATLAS entities.
Patterns
○ An array of references to Pattern objects, which the Entity is an instance of.
Attributes
○ A map from Attribute references to Packets, or generalized containers for data.
These containers are left flexible to allow DDOs to create or integrate any data
structures appropriate for their use case. The kinds of Attributes associated with
an Entity are held as a retrievable array of keys to allow for flexibility in
16
ATLAS - 10.5281/zenodo.10362561
assignment. Attributes generally become entered into an Entity attribute map via
an iQuery, but an Attribute can also be manually assigned.
Methods
Mark Anomaly
○ A procedure for marking this Entity as an anomaly to a specific iQuery (see
Section titled iQuery for more information on anomalies).
Mark Exception
○ A procedure for marking this Entity as an exception in relation to a specific
iQuery (see Section titled iQuery for more information on exceptions).
CallRFIs
○ A procedure for calling open requests for information (RFI), generated from
Entity Attributes which both (i) have no values and (ii) have iQueries through
which the Entity has not been marked as an anomaly or exception.
The Attributes associated with an ATLAS Entity, in NoSQL fashion, have no dedicated schema.
Entity objects may contain any number of functional Attributes.
17
ATLAS - 10.5281/zenodo.10362561
Pattern
Figure 10. Pattern component definition.
Patterns are a subclass of the Entity class, representing patterns of abstract phenomena and
objects which other Entity objects might be instantiations or examples of. Entity objects contain
the following properties:
Properties
QKit
○ QKit, short for Question Kit, contains an array of references to iQuery objects that
represent the set of requests for information which are expected to be made and
resolved if an object is assigned this pattern.
Parents
○ The Parents array contains Patterns with the following property: any Entity
assigned to this Pattern object should also be assigned to each pattern in the
Parents array. For example, a Pattern “car” might have the Parent Pattern
“vehicle”, meaning that any Entity given the pattern “car” would also be assigned
the Pattern “vehicle”.
Children
○ Children holds an array of Pattern objects to which this Pattern object is a Parent.
18
ATLAS - 10.5281/zenodo.10362561
iQuery
Figure 11. iQuery component definition.
The iQuery class, short for itemized query, are structured queries or “probes” intended to manage
and facilitate the resolution of requests for information and leverage the latent information in
such requests. In the ATLAS system, the iQuery functions as a router, capturing all information
possible from both the resolution of the request and the implicit information in the request itself.
They contain, in the form of Prompt Interfaces, an array of (i) potential approaches for
requesting, receiving, and retrieving information from within and without the ATLAS, from
humans, formulas, webhooks, API calls, survey instruments, algorithms, LLMs, or other
computational, mathematical, social, or mixed methods and (ii) methods to package resulting
information into the appropriate Attributes of the Entity subjected to the iQuery. Where the
resulting value or values being routed to a particular Attribute are or include discrete ATLAS
Entity objects, as opposed to some other Data Type (e.g., a String, Datetime, or Integer), the
iQuery also helps to assign Patterns to those resulting Entity values. For example, where the
Attribute of interest is “Original Publisher” and the human-legible prompt is “What Organization
is the Original Publisher of this document?”, there is information latent in the request for
information - any Entity which is provided as a response to the question might fit the Patterns
“Organization” or “Publisher”. As such, the iQuery also functions as a generator, as Patterns
contain “QKits”, or arrays of iQuery objects which should be attached to any Entity assigned
19
ATLAS - 10.5281/zenodo.10362561
said Pattern, therefore iQuery objects, through their automatic assignment of Patterns in
resolution of requests for information generate new requests for information.
There are three properties that distinguish iQuery from e.g. an empty database value, a question
on an online forum, or a request in a wiki editing system:
1. An iQuery is generalizable across all Entity objects of similar type, this is to say that it
can represent a simple question, but it also allows that question to automatically be asked
of every object which fits a given Pattern. For instance, if we ask “what is the Original
Publisher of this document?”, this iQuery is automatically requested of every Entity
which fits the Pattern “Document”, by merit of being contained within the “Document”
Pattern.
2. An iQuery not only routes resulting information to an Attribute value, but also utilizes
latent information to assist in the dynamic typing of defined objects (e.g. Entity objects)
in order to generate new iQuery objects. In other words, each iQuery holds the potential
to both (i) exponentially expand the knowledge base and (ii) manage exponential
expansion through careful structure and networking of existing components.
3. An iQuery reveals knowledge gaps by default, demanding resolution of information
requests within the ATLAS, as well as allowing for alternative methods to resolve
requests where the requested information is simply unavailable; this feature helps avoid
erroneous or impossible requests. Specifically, the iQuery allows the marking of
Exceptions and Anomalies (described below). Further, because (i) any Attribute can be
assigned to any Entity and (ii) an iQuery is the basis for routing requests, an Attribute
with an empty data value only continues to request information if the relevant Entity has
an iQuery which routes to that Attribute - which means that reassignment of Patterns
allows for rapid removal of erroneous and impossible requests without impacting existing
valid data.
The iQuery class is one of the few objects in the ATLAS system that does not inherit from Entity,
instead acting as the core communications component among other ATLAS objects and the
world outside the ATLAS instance. The iQuery class contains the following properties:
Properties
RefID
○ A pointer to a RID used for managing merge, import, and export operations with
other ATLAS entities.
Prompts
○ An array of references to Prompt Interfaces, which are used to request, receive,
and retrieve information and package them into Data Types which can be received
by appropriate ATLAS attributes.

○ The Router contains a map of references to Attributes to arrays of Patterns which
should be assigned to Entity objects which are or are included within data packets
routed to said Attributes.
Exceptions
○ The Exceptions property contains an array of Entities which, by merit of an
assigned Pattern, were assigned this iQuery, but cannot or should not have a
response to it, by merit of the Entity being an exceptional object. For example,
consider an ATLAS Instance which includes a Pattern “US President”, which has
an iQuery and an associated Attribute “date of inaugural address”. Entity objects
representing US Presidents who did not perform an inaugural address, such as
Tyler, Fillmore, Johnson, Arthur, or Ford, might be labeled as an exception; in the
future, an analysis of exceptions might reveal the need for new Patterns which are
child Patterns of US President (i.e., Presidents which gave Inaugural Addresses
and Presidents which did not give Inaugural Addresses), or, in the case the
ATLAS is not specifically concerned with such distinctions, such Entity objects
can simply remain exceptions.
Anomalies
○ The Anomalies property contains Entities which, by merit of an assigned Pattern,
were assigned this iQuery, but either (i) cannot or should not have a response
because the Entity it is associated with may have been assigned a pattern
inappropriately, or (ii) have related automated or default Prompt Interfaces which
have generated data value collision indicating (a) reliability issues in data
sourcing, (b) errors in Prompt Interfaces, or (c) potential need to split or
restructure Attributes.

Attribute
Figure 12. Attribute component definition.
The Attribute class is a subclass of Entity, used to represent any Entity which might also
represent a property of another Entity. For example, “Date of Publication”, “Publisher”, and
“Title” could all constitute Attribute objects. In order to enable their usage in the ATLAS system,
they extend the Entity class to include the following properties and methods:
Properties
DataType
○ Data Type contains a reference to a either a primitive (e.g., integer, float, String)
or a DDO generated data structure, informing the ATLAS Instance of what kind
of information structure is placed in an Entity’s Attribute map where this Attribute
is listed. This is left very flexible, to ensure that any data structure the DDO sees
as appropriate may be used.
Identifier
○ Identifier contains a Boolean, which, if True, indicates that this Attribute may be
used as an “identifier” of an Entity, for example a name, picture, ID, or other
identifying value.
Methods
22
ATLAS - 10.5281/zenodo.10362561
* These Methods are not necessary for an ATLAS to function, but were included in response to
feedback in order to express how an ATLAS itself can serve as data for analytics that can be
implemented by a DDO.
Call Anomalies
○ Call Anomalies is a procedure which queries the ATLAS to retrieve all Entities
that (i) had iQuery objects linked to this Attribute, and (ii) were marked as
anomalies, helping to analyze reliability of data import pipelines enabled by
Prompt Interfaces.
Call Exceptions
○ Call Exceptions is a procedure which queries the ATLAS to retrieve all Entities
that (i) had iQuery objects linked to this Attribute, and (ii) were marked as
exceptions, helping to analyze quality and stability of and patterns within the
Pattern structure implemented in the ATLAS (e.g., helping to discover Pattern
objects with many shared Attributes, or Pattern objects with excessive
exceptions).
Prompt Interface
Prompt Interface objects contain (i) potential approaches to requesting, receiving, and retrieving
information from within and without the ATLAS, from humans or formulas, webhooks, API
calls, survey instruments, algorithms, LLMs, or other computational, mathematical, social, or
mixed methods and (ii) methods to package resulting information into the appropriate Attributes
of the Entity subjected to the iQuery objects in which they are referenced. They extend the Entity
class to include technical properties or methods defined by a DDO based on what is appropriate
for their use-case, limitations, and requirements. Prompt Interfaces may be as complicated or as
simple as needed and can be implemented to interact with any system or subsystem capable of
taking requests and serving outputs, including other ATLAS instances (see Figure 13) or the
ATLAS instance itself. For example, a DDO might implement Prompt Interfaces with simple
conditional statements to enable other forms of dynamic typing, or run statistics on public
sentiment using APIs in relation to Entities intended to represent psychographics. The Prompt
Interface class was made to extend the Entity class in order to allow ATLAS Instances to map
certain aspects of their own function (e.g., Patterns of Prompt Interfaces).

Information Exchange Environments and Verified Information
Exchange Environments
The structure provided by ATLAS, as noted elsewhere, is intended to facilitate information
exchange with the outside, non-ATLAS-structured world of interactions. Here the
“non-ATLAS-structured world” refers to those information exchange interactions that do not
make use of the ATLAS-powered IXEs or VIEs to de-risk or leverage their interactions.
Information Exchange Environments and Verified Information Exchange Environment
designations are intended to clarify the roles and interactions of ATLAS instances
communicating with one another, and with the non-ATLAS-structured world.
Figure 13. Schematic of interactions among Information Exchange Environments (IXE) and
Verified Information Exchange Environments (VIE).
24
ATLAS - 10.5281/zenodo.10362561
Information Exchange Environment (IXE)
Any ATLAS instance constitutes an Information Exchange Environment if its DDO:
1. makes some portion of the ATLAS instance’s Entity and/or iQuery objects available for
continuous or on-demand retrieval by another ATLAS instance’s Prompt Interfaces, and,
2. provides mechanisms for (a) splitting and (b) merging of Entity and iQuery objects if the
ATLAS instance itself implements continuous or on-demand retrieval from some other
Information Exchange Environment.
Self-Designation as an IXE indicates to other systems that the ATLAS instance is designed,
developed, and operated with anticipation of supporting exchange of iQuery objects. This
designation also communicates that, if that ATLAS instance both receives and serves data, that it
has the necessary mechanisms to integrate external content with internal content at scales and/or
levels of complexity beyond capacity of both cognition and manual operations for individual
users.
Verified Information Exchange Environment (VIE)
Any ATLAS instance which, via a DDO:
1. meets the criteria to constitute an Information Exchange Environment,
2. implements defined and clearly communicated quality assurance standards and
procedures, as well as assigning specific duties of care to parties performing information
and data management related functions and services (together “Verified Execution”), and
3. provides (i) measurable functional reliability in information availability and
specifications informing expectations of structure and quality and (ii) enforcement and
remedies of 3.(i) (together “Verified Enforcement”).
VIEs are IXEs that offer one or more “verification” features in addition to IXE functionality.
Such verification features enhance the reliability and value of VIEs for relying parties. The set of
VIEs are a subset of IXEs that are organized and operated with affordances (listed in 2 and 3
above) that are intended to inform realistic organization and user expectations and to cultivate
trust in specific contexts and use cases beyond the baseline functionality of an IXE. A VIE is
intended to constitute a reliable party in a larger information supply chain or network in which it
is situated. Moreover a VIE is organized and operated to provide Verified Execution and
operations in accordance with explicit standards and Verified Enforcement of such standards
including conflict resolution and change management capabilities such as handling issues in
DMCA takedown notices, removal of illegal material, and notices of key changes and
retractions. The provision of such additional “verification” affordances is not a guarantee, but
reduces risk (and enhances value) for system users that rely on the system in specific and
measurable ways.

Core Mechanisms and Implications
Discussed below, are implications and mechanisms which emerge from interactions among
components within the ATLAS system.
Dynamic Typing and Management of Exponential Expansion
Given that (i) dynamic Pattern assignment occurs as a result of resolution of requests for
information, (ii) new Entity objects can be generated in the process of resolving requests for
information, and (iii) Pattern assignment results in new requests for information, an ATLAS
instance facilitates rapid expansion of a knowledge base (see Figure 5). However, this expansion
is not exponential - given that (i) the system is driven by Entity reference and structured,
itemized queries (iQuery objects), (ii) resolving requests for information networks existing Entity
objects, and (iii) ATLAS instances do not need to be concerned with containing all available
information or patterns, only those which are relevant to a particular use case, the accumulation
of new objects instead is expected to follow a sigmoid curve, wherein, the rate of accumulation
will hit a key inflection point as iQuery objects begin to network more existing objects than they
generate.

routing of values resolving requests for information to Attributes.

Figure 15. Representation of the role of iQuery objects using Entity objects representing an
Article and a Publisher as an example.
Information Supply Chains
Supply chains require reliability, either through quality assurance or availability of remedy. The
designation of ATLAS instances as Verified Information Environments (VIEs) where responsible
parties set expectations of quality assurance, functional reliability of availability and data
structure, and duties of care, in combination with the flexibility of Prompt Interfaces, allows for
VIEs to constitute components and reliable parties within a navigable information supply chain.
Prompt Interface interoperability with APIs and other forms of structured data exchange could
further allow for compensation in the process. It is contemplated that a variety of VIEs will be
established to serve the needs of information system relying parties in a variety of contexts and
domains, including governmental, commercial and proprietary, academic, and cultural. Some
VIEs may offer execution and enforcement functions that will constitute “fiduciary” type
intermediation, while others will not. Some VIEs will be proprietary/paywalled systems, while
others will be free and open access. In each case, successful VIEs will be those that are
responsive to the needs of specific populations of users in a variety of business, operating, legal,
technical, and social groupings. Overall, the additional value offered by VIEs will create a VIE
“layer” of the ecosystem, offering greater regularity and choice to users in their information
exchanges powered by a centralized and dynamic resource of the shared ATLAS infrastructure.
27

Data Interoperability without Shared Standards
Attributes within the ATLAS system are an extension of the Entity class, which means that they
carry Reference IDs and their own Attributes and Patterns, which may include documentation,
version history, quality standards, and examples. Attributes can be shared between systems and
linked via common Reference IDs despite differing ontology or split despite overlaps in
ontology, and Prompt Interfaces can be used to call and transform data between such systems
(e.g., where one system might use “datetime”, another might just use a “date” for an Attribute of
the same name - or both systems might use the same name for notably different Attribute
objects). Pattern assignment within Entity objects can help reveal duplicates or opportunities for
transformation, or support comparability of analysis of Entity objects of varying types without
requiring new Attributes. For example, “Date of Publication”, “Date of Announcement’, and
“Date of Product Launch” might all share a common Pattern of “Release Date”, allowing for
Entity objects which do not share each of these Attributes to be compared without manual data
transformation or a new shared standard. Local ATLAS instances, by merit of Attribute objects
being Entity objects, generate minimal viable documentation on their Attributes by default -
allowing for interoperability of data even where schemas are not agreed upon.
Figure 16. Representation of shared data despite varying schema and ontology.
Restructuring and Maintaining Navigability
The nature of the components allows for several methods for handling cases where an ATLAS
instance has become bloated, difficult to navigate, or where easier navigation or a new scope is
necessary:
1. Filters can be used to copy an ATLAS instance and abandon the original to remove
unnecessary or erroneous information without necessarily having to delete any
information or damage accessibility in the future.
28
ATLAS - 10.5281/zenodo.10362561
2. DDOs can implement version control to revert to prior snapshots and a variety of
methods for duplicate detection and effective merge functions.
3. Filters and Prompt Interfaces in a new ATLAS instance can be used to request Entity
objects of particular types from an existing ATLAS, in order to present a more specific
version (see Figure 2) or to manage sensitive and targeted releases of information.
4. Orphan objects, or Entity objects which are not networked with the rest of the knowledge
base or have no Attributes (dead objects) are immediately identifiable and easily removed
if unnecessary. If the orphan Entity objects are relevant and useful to the ATLAS, but for
some reason were left unconnected, manual assignment of Patterns would likely result in
either navigation of previously unexplored areas of potentially relevant information,
connection to the existing knowledge base, or both.
5. Any Entity can be manually assigned or unassigned Patterns and Attributes as needed,
allowing for both individual edits or algorithmic (mass) edits across the entire ATLAS.
Disagreement as Valuable Data
Shared Reference IDs resulting from exchange among supply chain components enables
liquidity in sharing networked information, but also allows for disambiguation and detection of
conflicts and disagreements in complicated ontologies, references, and related data. Given the
ATLAS system’s focus on networking local knowledge bases, as opposed to generating a single
universal knowledge base, both agreement and disagreement over discrete Attribute values
across communities are rendered measurable. DDOs can also implement data structures which
measure such disagreement within an individual ATLAS instance as well.
Flexible Presentation Without Changes to Underlying Data
The ATLAS system is built on the principle that there is no single authoritative view on any
Entity. Patterns are used to assign collections of expected Attributes to objects, without the need
to set a strict standard or schema associated with any individual Entity. As such, choices in
presentation of underlying data is left flexible. Further, given that presentation is tied to discrete
Attribute values, modular presentations of data with connectivity to ATLAS data can be rendered
in real- or near-real time with continuous updates.
Measurement of Knowledge Bases and Time Series Analysis
Structuring of an ATLAS instance’s knowledge into discrete, referenceable components allows
for measurement of disagreement over the data values of those components, as well as
measurement of changes to those data values, and the accumulation of and relationships among
components over time. Where ATLAS instances are deployed with iQuery objects built to
interface with existing knowledge bases or LLMs, an ATLAS instance can be used as a
measurement tool to reveal insights about the structure of external information sources - or, its
being applied to said knowledge bases can be used as a method for measuring the quality of an
29
ATLAS - 10.5281/zenodo.10362561
ATLAS instance’s structure (e.g., iQuery and Prompt flexibility for integrating external
information without human assistance).
